GRI Standards require reporting organisations to cover topics 
that reflect the reporting organisation’s significant economic, 
environmental, and social impacts or substantively influence the 
assessments and decisions of stakeholders (‘material topics’). 
An ‘impact’ can refer to positive, negative, actual, potential, 
direct, indirect, short-term, long-term, intended, or  
unintended impacts. 
The TCFD recommends reporting information specific to the 
potential impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on 
the organisation’s markets, businesses, corporate or investment 
strategy, financial statements, and future cash flows (Principle 1). 
Reporting against the mapped GRI disclosures will likely provide 
the information sought by the TCFD, since an organisation’s 
impacts reported about climate-related material topics can 
capture risks and opportunities that affect the organisation’s 
markets, businesses, corporate or investment strategy,  
financial statements, and future cash flows and will capture 
additional information.
