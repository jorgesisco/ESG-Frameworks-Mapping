Disclosure 303-3-c requires a 
breakdown of the water withdrawn 
from each of the sources (surface water, 
groundwater, seawater, produced water, 
third-party water) by the categories 
freshwater and other water. GRI’s 
definition of freshwater is water with a

water constitutes any water that has a

W1.2h distinguishes between fresh 
surface water and brackish surface 
water/seawater based on the 
concentration of total dissolved solids. 
Fresh surface water is defined by CDP 
as having a low concentration of total 
dissolved solids – at least below 10,000 
mg/L. (‘High quality’ fresh water sources 
are typically characterized as having 
concentrations of total dissolved solids 
less than 1,000 mg/L). Brackish surface 
water has a high concentration of total 
dissolved solids – at least higher than 
10,000 mg/L. Finally, seawater has a
