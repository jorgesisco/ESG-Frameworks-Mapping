GRI Standards require reporting organisations to cover topics that reflect the reporting organisation’s significant economic, environmental, and social impacts or substantively influence the assessments and decisions of stakeholders (‘material topics’).
An ‘impact’ can refer to positive, negative, actual, potential, direct, indirect, short-term, long-term, intended, or unintended impacts.
The TCFD recommends reporting information specific to the potential impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organisation’s markets, businesses, corporate or investment strategy, financial statements, and future cash flows (Principle 1).
Reporting against the mapped GRI disclosures will likely provide the information sought by the TCFD, since an organisation’s impacts reported about climate-related material topics can capture risks and opportunities that affect the organisation’s markets, businesses, corporate or investment strategy, financial statements, and future cash flows and will capture additional information.
However, users must be aware that reporting with the GRI Standards may not necessarily capture all of the information sought by the TCFD recommended disclosure.
