1,The purpose of theconceptual framework,"SP1.1: The ConceptualFramework for FinancialReporting describes the objectiveof, and the concepts for, generalpurpose financial reporting.The purpose of the ConceptualFramework is to:(a) assist the InternationalAccounting Standards Board(Board) to develop IFRSStandards (Standards) that arebased on consistent concepts;(b) assist preparers to developconsistent accounting policieswhen no Standard applies to aparticular transaction or otherevent, or when a Standardallows a choice of accountingpolicy; and(c) assist all parties to understandand interpret the Standards.SP1.2: The ConceptualFramework is not a Standard.Nothing in the ConceptualFramework overrides anyStandard or any requirementin a Standard.","IN1: The IFRS Practice StatementManagement Commentaryprovides a broad, non bindingframework for the presentation ofmanagement commentary thatrelates to financial statementsthat have been prepared inaccordance with InternationalFinancial Reporting Standards(IFRSs).IN2: The Practice Statementis not an IFRS. Consequently,entities applying IFRSs arenot required to comply with thePractice Statement, unlessspecifically required by theirjurisdiction. Furthermore, noncompliance with the PracticeStatement will not prevent anentity’s financial statements fromcomplying with IFRSs, if theyotherwise do so.","1. Purpose:The CDSB Framework setsout an approach to reportingenvironmental information inmainstream reports.(...)The CDSB Framework assumesthat the following mattersare routinely disclosed in amainstream report and thereforeprovide context for environmentalinformation reported according tothe CDSB Framework:• The organisation’s principalactivities and business model;• The main markets andjurisdictions in which theorganisation operates;• A description of theorganisation’s supply chain;and• Other key legal, staffing andperformance indicators","A. Background onsustainability reporting - GRIFoundation 2016GRI 101: Foundation applies toany organisation that wants to usethe GRI Standards to report aboutits economic, environmental, and/or social impacts. Therefore, thisStandard is applicable to:• an organisation that intends toprepare a sustainability reportin accordance with the GRIStandards; or• an organisation that intends touse selected GRI Standards,or parts of their content, toreport on impacts related tospecific economic, social, and/or environmental topics (e.g.,to report on emissions only).GRI 101 can be used by anorganisation of any size, type,sector, or geographic location.","1.3: The purpose of thisFramework is to establish GuidingPrinciples and Content Elementsthat govern the overall contentof an integrated report, and toexplain the fundamental conceptsthat underpin them.1.4: This Framework is writtenprimarily in the context of privatesector, for-profit companiesof any size but it can also beapplied, adapted as necessary,by public sector and not-for-profitorganizations.1.5: This Framework identifiesinformation to be included inan integrated report for use inassessing an organisation’s abilityto create value; it does not setbenchmarks for such things asthe quality of an organisation’sstrategy or the level of itsperformance.1.6: In this Framework, referenceto the creation of value:• Includes instances whenvalue is preserved and when itis diminished• Relates to value creation overtime (i.e., over the short-,medium- and long-term).","6: This Conceptual Frameworkarticulates the key conceptsillustrated in Figure 2. Theseconcepts serve three purposes.First, they act as a guide tothe Standards Board andtechnical staff in carryingout their standard-settingactivities. Second, they can helpstakeholders better understandSASB’s approach to standardsetting. Third, they can helpto improve the StandardsBoard’s and technical staff’sengagement and consultationwith stakeholders by providinga common language forcommunication.",
