2,"The purpose of the 
conceptual framework","SP1.1: The Conceptual 
Framework for Financial 
Reporting describes the objective 
of, and the concepts for, general 
purpose financial reporting. 
The purpose of the Conceptual 
Framework is to:
(a) assist the International 
Accounting Standards Board 
(Board) to develop IFRS 
Standards (Standards) that are 
based on consistent concepts;
(b) assist preparers to develop 
consistent accounting policies 
when no Standard applies to a 
particular transaction or other 
event, or when a Standard 
allows a choice of accounting 
policy; and
(c) assist all parties to understand 
and interpret the Standards.
SP1.2: The Conceptual 
Framework is not a Standard. 
Nothing in the Conceptual 
Framework overrides any 
Standard or any requirement 
in a Standard.","IN1: The IFRS Practice Statement 
Management Commentary 
provides a broad, non binding 
framework for the presentation of 
management commentary that 
relates to financial statements 
that have been prepared in 
accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs).
IN2: The Practice Statement 
is not an IFRS. Consequently, 
entities applying IFRSs are 
not required to comply with the 
Practice Statement, unless 
specifically required by their 
jurisdiction. Furthermore, non 
compliance with the Practice 
Statement will not prevent an 
entity’s financial statements from 
complying with IFRSs, if they 
otherwise do so.","1. Purpose:
The CDSB Framework sets 
out an approach to reporting 
environmental information in 
mainstream reports.(...)
The CDSB Framework assumes 
that the following matters 
are routinely disclosed in a 
mainstream report and therefore 
provide context for environmental 
information reported according to 
the CDSB Framework:
• The organisation’s principal 
activities and business model;
• The main markets and 
jurisdictions in which the 
organisation operates;
• A description of the 
organisation’s supply chain; 
and
• Other key legal, staffing and 
performance indicators","A. Background on 
sustainability reporting - GRI 
Foundation 2016
GRI 101: Foundation applies to 
any organisation that wants to use 
the GRI Standards to report about 
its economic, environmental, and/
or social impacts. Therefore, this 
Standard is applicable to: 
• an organisation that intends to 
prepare a sustainability report 
in accordance with the GRI 
Standards; or 
• an organisation that intends to 
use selected GRI Standards, 
or parts of their content, to 
report on impacts related to 
specific economic, social, and/
or environmental topics (e.g., 
to report on emissions only). 
GRI 101 can be used by an 
organisation of any size, type, 
sector, or geographic location.","1.3: The purpose of this 
Framework is to establish Guiding 
Principles and Content Elements 
that govern the overall content 
of an integrated report, and to 
explain the fundamental concepts 
that underpin them.
1.4: This Framework is written 
primarily in the context of private 
sector, for-profit companies 
of any size but it can also be 
applied, adapted as necessary, 
by public sector and not-for-profit 
organizations.
1.5: This Framework identifies 
information to be included in 
an integrated report for use in 
assessing an organisation’s ability 
to create value; it does not set 
benchmarks for such things as 
the quality of an organisation’s 
strategy or the level of its 
performance.
1.6: In this Framework, reference 
to the creation of value:
• Includes instances when 
value is preserved and when it 
is diminished
• Relates to value creation over 
time (i.e., over the short-, 
medium- and long-term).","6: This Conceptual Framework 
articulates the key concepts 
illustrated in Figure 2. These 
concepts serve three purposes. 
First, they act as a guide to 
the Standards Board and 
technical staff in carrying 
out their standard-setting 
activities. Second, they can help 
stakeholders better understand 
SASB’s approach to standard 
setting. Third, they can help 
to improve the Standards 
Board’s and technical staff’s 
engagement and consultation 
with stakeholders by providing 
a common language for 
communication.",,,

to provide financial information 
about the reporting entity that is 
useful to existing and potential

creditors in making decisions 
relating to providing resources to 
the entity.","9: Management commentary 
should provide users of financial 
statements with integrated 
information that provides a 
context for the related financial 
statements. Such information 
explains management’s view not 
only about what has happened, 
including both positive and 
negative circumstances, but also 
why it has happened and what 
the implications are for the entity’s 
future
10: Management commentary 
complements and supplements 
the financial statements by 
communicating integrated 
information about the entity’s 
resources and the claims against 
the entity and its resources, and 
the transactions and other events 
that change them.
11: Management commentary 
should also explain the main 
trends and factors that are 
likely to affect the entity’s 
future performance, position 
and progress. Consequently, 
management commentary looks 
not only at the present, but also at 
the past and the future.","2. Objectives
The objectives of the CDSB 
Framework are to:…Align with 
and complement the objective of 
financial reporting, i.e., to provide 
environmental information about 
the reporting organisation that 
is connected with financial and 
other information and is useful 
to present and potential equity 
investors, lenders and other 
creditors in making decisions 
in their capacity as capital 
providers.","A. Background on 
sustainability reporting - GRI 
Foundation 2016 
Sustainability reporting, as 
promoted by the GRI Standards, 
is an organisation’s practice 
of reporting publicly on its 
economic, environmental, and/
or social impacts, and hence 
its contributions – positive or 
negative – towards the goal of 
sustainable development.","Integrated Reporting (<IR>) 
promotes a more cohesive and 
efficient approach to corporate 
reporting and aims to improve the 
quality of information available 
to providers of financial capital 
to enable a more efficient and 
productive allocation of capital
1.7: The primary purpose of an 
integrated report is to explain to 
providers of financial capital how 
an organisation creates value 
over time. It therefore contains 
relevant information, both 
financial and other.
1.8: An integrated report benefits 
all stakeholders interested 
in an organisation’s ability 
to create value over time, 
including employees, customers, 
suppliers, business partners, 
local communities, legislators, 
regulators and policy-makers.","34: The objectives of the SASB 
Standards are to facilitate the 
disclosure of sustainability 
information that is financially 
material, decision-useful, and 
cost effective.","i: ‘…widespread adoption will 
ensure that the effects of climate 
change become routinely 
considered in business and 
investment decisions. Adoption 
of these recommendations will 
also help companies better 
demonstrate responsibility and 
foresight in their consideration of 
climate issues. That will lead to 
smarter, more efficient allocation 
of capital, and help smooth the 
transition to a more sustainable, 
low-carbon economy.’",
3,,Users,"1.5: Many existing and potential 
investors, lenders and other 
creditors cannot require 
reporting entities to provide 
information directly to them and 
must rely on general purpose 
financial reports for much of the 
financial information they need. 
Consequently, they are the 
primary users to whom general 
purpose financial reports are 
directed","8: Management should 
determine the information 
to include in management 
commentary considering the 
needs of the primary users of 
financial reports. Those users 
are existing and potential 
investors, lenders and other 
creditors.","5. Intended audience for 
information reported according 
to the CDSB Framework
The CDSB Framework is 
designed to help organisations 
report environmental information 
in mainstream reports and 
therefore the intended audience 
is investors as they are the 
primary users of mainstream 
reports. While the CDSB 
Framework concentrates on 
investors as the primary users 
of the environmental information 
presented in the mainstream 
report, it recognises that the 
information may satisfy the 
needs of other stakeholders too.","GRI does not explicitly define their 
users. Sustainability information 
is of interest to a broad range 
of users, including investors, 
companies, policy makers, 
civil society, employees, and 
customers.","1.7: The primary purpose of an

An integrated report aims 
to provide insight about the 
resources and relationships 
used and affected by an 
organisation – these are 
collectively referred to as “the 
capitals” in this Framework (p.4) 
The six capitals are – financial, 
manufactured, intellectual, 
human, social and relationship, 
and natural","15: The SASB Standards are

capital or otherwise rely on the 
capital markets.","1. Background
“(…) climate-related disclosures

3,"Reporting Entity and 
Reporting Boundaries","3.10: A reporting entity is an entity 
that is required, or chooses, to 
prepare financial statements. 
(…) A reporting entity is not 
necessarily a legal entity.
3.11: Sometimes one entity 
(parent) has control over 
another entity (subsidiary). If a 
reporting entity comprises both 
the parent and its subsidiaries, 
the reporting entity’s financial 
statements are referred to as 
consolidated financial statements’ 
(see paragraphs 3.15–3.16). If 
a reporting entity is the parent 
alone, the reporting entity’s 
financial statements are referred 
to as ‘unconsolidated financial 
statements’ (see paragraphs 
3.17–3.18).
3.13: Determining the appropriate 
boundary of a reporting entity can 
be difficult if the reporting entity:
(a) is not a legal entity; and
(b) does not comprise only legal 
entities linked by a parent-
subsidiary relationship.
3.14: In such cases, determining 
the boundary of the reporting 
entity is driven by the information 
needs of the primary users of 
the reporting entity’s financial 
statements. Those users need 
relevant information that faithfully 
represents what it purports to 
represent (…).",,"REQ-07 
Organisational boundary
Environmental information 
shall be prepared for the 
entities within the boundary 
of the organisation, or group, 
for which the mainstream 
report is prepared and, where 
appropriate, shall distinguish 
information reported for entities 
and activities outside that 
boundary. The basis on which 
the organisational reporting 
boundary has been determined 
shall be described.","Topic boundary
Description of where the impacts 
occur for a material topic, and 
the organisation’s involvement 
with those impacts","3.30: Key to the materiality 
determination process is 
the concept of the reporting 
boundary. Determining the 
boundary for an integrated report 
has two aspects:
• The financial reporting entity 
(i.e., the boundary used for 
financial reporting purposes)
• Risks, opportunities and 
outcomes attributable to or 
associated with other entities/
stakeholders beyond the 
financial reporting entity that 
have a significant effect on the 
ability of the financial reporting 
entity to create value.
3.31 The financial reporting 
entity is central to the reporting 
boundary (…)","Application Guidance,  
Section 3.0
The reporting boundaries for 
disclosures that conform with the 
SASB standards shall include all 
parent and subordinate entities 
that are consolidated for financial 
reporting purposes. Disclosures 
for consolidated entities shall 
not be adjusted for minority 
interests.
Unconsolidated entities shall 
be excluded from the reporting 
boundaries. However, the entity 
should disclose information 
about unconsolidated entities 
to the extent that the entity 
considers such information 
necessary to understand the 
effect of one or more SASB 
disclosure topics on the entity’s 
financial condition or operating 
performance.","The complexity and uncertainty 
associated with climate change 
make it difficult to identify the 
specific touchpoints and time 
frames in which climate change 
may affect an organisation. As 
a starting point, an organisation 
should assess its value chain 
over a reasonable time frame as 
it relates to the
following:
- climate-related risks including 
(1) transition risks such as 
policy constraints on emissions, 
imposition of carbon tax, water 
restrictions, land use restrictions 
or incentives, and market 
demand and supply shifts and 
(2) physical risks such as the 
disruption of operations or 
destruction of property and
- climate-related opportunities 
such as access to new markets 
and new technology (e.g., 
carbon capture and storage 
technology).",,

depiction is not slanted, weighted, 
emphasised, deemphasised or 
otherwise manipulated to increase 
the probability that financial 
information will be received 
favourably or unfavourably by users. 
Neutral information does not mean 
information with no purpose or no 
influence on behaviour. On the 
contrary, relevant financial information 
is, by definition, capable of making a 
difference in users’ decisions.","P2: Disclosures shall be faithfully 
represented
Neutral information is free from bias so 
that it faithfully represents the matter 
that it purports to represent. Neutral 
information does not colour the image 
it communicates to influence behaviour 
in a particular direction. Disclosure 
of environmental information is 
not neutral if, by the selection 
or presentation of information, it 
influences decision-making or 
judgment in order to achieve a 
predetermined result or outcome. 
However, to say that disclosure should 
be neutral does not mean that it should 
be without purpose or that it should not 
influence behaviour. On the contrary, 
relevant environmental information is, 
by definition, capable of influencing 
users’ decisions.
For the purposes of management 
commentary, information is free from 
bias, or “balanced”, where it does not 
unnecessarily overemphasise positive 
news but deals even-handedly with 
both “positive” and “negative” aspects.","Balanced (478): The organization 
shall report information in an

F",Free from Error,"2.18: Faithful representation does 
not mean accurate in all respects. 
Free from error means there are 
no errors or omissions in the 
description of the phenomenon, 
and the process used to produce 
the reported information has been 
selected and applied with no errors 
in the process. In this context, free 
from error does not mean perfectly 
accurate in all respects. (...). However, 
a representation of that estimate can 
be faithful if the amount is described 
clearly and accurately as being an 
estimate, the nature and limitations of 
the estimating process are explained, 
and no errors have been made in 
selecting and applying an appropriate 
process for developing the estimate.","P2: Disclosures shall be faithfully 
represented
(...) faithful representation does 
not imply total freedom from error. 
However, faithful representation 
of information may be achieved by 
ensuring that sufficient evidence is 
available to support disclosures and 
that information is provided about 
the nature and degree of omissions, 
assumptions and uncertainty and 
by basing estimates on appropriate 
and neutral inputs that reflect 
the best available information. 
Therefore, in order to attain faithful 
representation, it may sometimes be 
necessary to disclose explicitly the 
degree of uncertainty in the reported 
information.","Accuracy (457): The organization 
shall report information that is 
factually correct and sufficiently 
detailed to enable the assessment 
of the organization’s impacts.
To apply the Accuracy principle, the 
organisation should:
-   report qualitative information that is 
consistent with available evidence 
and other reported information
-   indicate which data has been 
measured;
-   adequately describe data 
measurements and bases for 
calculations,(...);
-   indicate which data has been 
estimated, the underlying 
assumptions and techniques 
used for the estimation, and any 
limitations.","3.46: Freedom from material error 
does not imply that the information is 
perfectly accurate in all respects. It 
does imply that:
-   Processes and controls have been 
applied to reduce to an acceptably 
low level the risk that reported 
information contains a material 
misstatement;
-   When information includes 
estimates, this is clearly 
communicated, and the nature and 
limitations of the estimation process 
are explained.","Neutral - Characteristics of

Metrics are neutral if they are free 
from bias and value judgment, so that 
they yield an objective measure of 
performance related to the disclosure

Verifiable - Characteristics 
of Sustainability Accounting 
Metrics: Metrics are verifiable if 
their calculation or production can be 
replicated by others who follow the 
same guidance. Verifiability can help 
support the development of effective 
internal controls and enable external 
assurance.","Principle 6: Disclosures should be 
reliable, verifiable, and objective:
-   (…) To the extent possible, 
disclosures should be based on 
objective data and use best-in-
class measurement methodologies, 
which would include common 
industry practice as it evolves.
-   Disclosures should be defined, 
collected, recorded, and analysed 
in such a way that the information 
reported is verifiable to ensure 
it is high quality. For future-
oriented information, this means 
assumptions used can be traced 
back to their sources.",
2,,Comparability,,"2.25: Comparability is the qualitative 
characteristic that enables users to 
identify and understand similarities in, 
and differences among, items. Unlike 
the other qualitative characteristics, 
comparability does not relate to a 
single item. A comparison requires at 
least two items.
2.26: Consistency, although related 
to comparability, is not the same. 
Consistency refers to the use of the 
same methods for the same items, 
either from period to period within a 
reporting entity or in a single period 
across entities. Comparability is the 
goal; consistency helps to achieve 
that goal.","P4: Disclosures shall be consistent 
and comparable
Purpose: To elicit information of value 
to investors in a way that is consistent 
so as to enable a level of comparability 
between similar organisations, 
reporting periods and sectors. 
(...)
In the early years of adoption, it is 
recognised that comparability (...) 
between organisations and sectors 
may be limited, (...). However, within 
an entity, comparability over time 
should be achievable and depends 
primarily on the consistency of 
approach to reporting year-on-year.","Comparability (507): The 
organization shall select, 
compile, and report information 
in a consistent manner, to enable 
the analysis of changes in the 
organization’s impacts over time 
and the analysis of these impacts 
relative to other organizations
Comparability is necessary for 
evaluating an organisation’s current 
impacts against its past impacts and 
its goals and targets, and against the 
impacts of other organisations.
Consistency allows for assessing 
progress and for benchmarking by 
the organisation or external parties 
as part of rating activities, investment 
decisions, and advocacy programs, 
among other activities.","3.54: The information in an integrated 
report should be presented: (a) on a 
basis that is consistent over time; and 
(b) in a way that enables comparison 
with other organizations to the extent 
it is material to the organization’s own 
ability to create value over time","Comparable - Characteristics of 
Sustainability Accounting Metrics: 
Metrics are comparable if they permit 
users to identify which companies have 
similar versus different performance on 
a particular sustainability topic 
Prevalent - Characteristics of 
Sustainability Accounting Metrics: The 
decision-usefulness of sustainability 
disclosures is likely to be enhanced 
when the topics identified apply to 
many companies, both within a given 
industry and across geographies.
Aligned - Characteristics of 
Sustainability Accounting Metrics: 
Metrics are aligned if they are based 
on or consistent with other standards 
or regulations, common industry 
practices, or guidance already in use 
within an industry. Aligned metrics 
allow companies to use one metric for 
multiple reporting purposes.","Principle 5: Disclosures should be 
comparable among organizations

Disclosures should allow for 
meaningful comparisons of strategy, 
business activities, risks, and 
performance across organisations and

Principle 4: Disclosures should be 
consistent over time
Disclosures should be consistent over 
time to enable users to understand 
the development and/or evolution of 
the impact of climate-related issues 
on the organization’s business. 
Disclosures should be presented 
using consistent formats, language, 
and metrics from period to period to 
allow for inter-period comparisons.

depiction is a faithful representation. 
Quantified information need not be a

A range of possible amounts and

Verifiability means that different 
knowledgeable and independent 
observers could reach general 
consensus although not necessarily 
complete agreement, that there 
is no material error or bias in the 
disclosures, or that an appropriate 
approach has been taken without 
material error or bias. Verifiable 
information is characterised by 
supporting evidence that provides 
a clear and sufficient trail from 
monitored data to the presentation of 
environmental information. Verifiable 
quantified information need not be 
a single point estimate. A range 
of possible amounts and related 
probabilities can also be verified.
Verification may be direct or indirect. 
Generally direct verification applies to 
a directly measured amount. Indirect 
verification checks the inputs and the 
resulting outputs by reference to the 
same methodology. Forward-looking 
information may not be verifiable until 
a future period.","Verifiability (600): The organization 
shall gather, record, compile, and 
analyze information in a way that 
the information can be examined to 
establish its credibility.
To apply the Verifiability principle, the 
organisation should:
-   ensure that individuals other than 
those involved in preparing the 
reported information are able to 
review the supporting internal 
controls and documentation; 
(...)
-   be able to provide representation 
from the original information 
sources, attesting to the accuracy 
of the reported information within 
acceptable margins of error","3.40: The reliability of information is 
affected by its balance and freedom 
from material error. Reliability 
(which is often referred to as faithful 
representation) is enhanced by 
mechanisms such as robust internal 
control and reporting systems, 
stakeholder engagement, internal audit 
or similar functions, and independent, 
external assurance

Disclosures should be defined, 
collected, recorded, and analysed 
in such a way that the information 
reported is verifiable to ensure it 
is high quality. For future-oriented 
information, this means assumptions 
used can be traced back to their 
sources. This does not imply a 
requirement for independent external 
assurance; however, disclosures 
should be subject to internal 
governance processes that are the 
same or substantially similar to those 
used for financial reporting.",
2,,Timeliness,,"2.33: Timeliness means having 
information available to decision-
makers in time to be capable of 
influencing their decisions. Generally, 
the older the information is the 
less useful it is. However, some 
information may continue to be timely 
long after the end of a reporting 
period because, for example, some 
users may need to identify and 
assess trends.","REQ-09: Reporting period
Disclosures shall be provided on an 
annual basis
The reporting period for 
environmental information and the 
mainstream report should be the 
same, for example, 12 months. 
However, where this not the case, 
the reporting year for environmental 
information should end within the 
period covered by the mainstream 
report and its start and end date 
should be disclosed.","Timeliness (581): The organization 
shall report information on a regular 
schedule and make it available in 
time for information users to make 
decisions.
The usefulness of information is 
closely tied to whether it is available in 
time for information users to integrate 
it into their decision-making. The 
Timeliness principle refers to how 
regularly information is reported, as 
well as how up to date the information 
is in relation to the reporting period.",,,"Principle 7: Disclosures should be 
provided on a timely basis
-   Information should be delivered to 
users or updated in a timely manner 
using appropriate media on, at 
least, an annual basis within the 
mainstream financial report.
-   Climate-related risks can result in 
disruptive events. In case of such 
events with a material financial 
impact, the organisation should 
provide a timely update of climate-
related disclosures as appropriate.",
3,,Understandability,,"2.34: Classifying, characterising and 
presenting information clearly and 
concisely makes it understandable.
2.35: Some phenomena are inherently 
complex and cannot be made easy 
to understand. Excluding information

would be incomplete and therefore 
possibly misleading.","P5: Disclosures shall be clear and 
understandable
Information that is relevant and 
material should not be excluded from 
Mainstream reports solely because

be used wherever possible although 
technical terminology with appropriate 
explanation should be used where 
relevant to an understanding of the 
environmental information.","Clarity (489): The organization shall

change in the future and why,

assessment of the entity’s 
prospects in the light of current
